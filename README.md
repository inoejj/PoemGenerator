# PoemGenerator
Have fun generating sentences! It might be that half of them are nonsense, or maybe more, but isn't that just a reflection of the creative process? As thinkers, as creators, we have so many thoughts everyday--more than half of them are definitely nonsense. This is the same. We're asking you to find those few lines of beauty in the nonsense, and create meaning where there seems to be none. It's an exercise in creativity and compassion. Like finding shapes in clouds. Like drawing constellations. There's something magic in these generated lines, if you're willing to look. If you're willing to find it. It might just take generating and regenerating these lines a few times.
